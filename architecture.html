        <!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"left","customFontSize":16} -->
<p style="font-size:15px" class="has-text-align-left">Fitzroy House is a proposal for a new building system, to address the housing crisis and genrefication in Fitzroy. It proposes a kit of parts (kind of like lego blocks) that low income earners can use to create livable spaces in the back alleys of Fitzroy streets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"customFontSize":16} -->
<p style="font-size:15px">I design Fitzroy Street as my final project for my Masters of Architecture. It sits somewhere in between architecture and games, and I encouraged the reviewers to imagine how they might use the building blocks to design housing solutions.</p>

        <div id="column2_games"><h1>Seoul School of Graffiti</h1>

        	<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"left","customFontSize":16} -->
<p style="font-size:16px" class="has-text-align-left">During the design for this scheme, I visited Seoul, and was really taken by how the city shows it age and history - the underside of a industrial bridge marked with the changing tides of a river, grass popping through concrete paths, graffiti on structural columns. I found it all pretty beautiful, and thought it would be nice to design a 'school' that showcases the different ways humans and non humans alike, leave their mark on the city.</p> 
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"left","customFontSize":16} -->
<p style="font-size:16px" class="has-text-align-left">I designed the 'school' for the <strong><a href="https://2023.seoulbiennale.org/indexENG.html">Seoul Biennale of Architecture and Urbanism</a> </strong>, and my submission was chosen for exhibition during the event!</p>
<p style="font-size:16px" class="has-text-align-left">It was also exhibited at the <strong><a href="https://www.uia-architectes.org/en/events/world-congresses-of-architects/copenhagen-2023_uia-architecture-congress-2/">World Congress of Architects</a> </strong>, as an example of architecture and nature existing in harmony.</p>

        <div id="column2_games"><h1>Museum of Routine</h1>

        	<p style="font-size:16px" class="has-text-align-left">In this project, I designed a park enclosed with a circular pavillion, where visitors could sit and watch people playing in the park. It was about creating times to stop, and watch. </p>
