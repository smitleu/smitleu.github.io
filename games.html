              Pigeon Game is a game about playing with... pigeons! In Pigeon
              Game, you can chase, feed, pet, befriend and hold pigeons. I made
              this game primarily as a thing for women and children to enjoy.
            </p>

            <h1>Dune Creatures</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 16px" class="has-text-align-left">
              Dune Creatures is a game I made in collaboration with BlacketSmith
              Architects, and is about exploring spaces that many people will
              never see. It's based off a model of their 'North Coogee Picnic
              Shelters' - you can read about the physical structure

                  >here</a
                > </strong
              >. I wanted to play with bringing physical places onto the virtual
              plane, and I had a great time doing it.

            <h1>DelEAT</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 16px" class="has-text-align-left">
              DelEAT was a game I was commissioned to make for GDC Delete 2019.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 16px" class="has-text-align-left">
              The premise of Delete was that all the featured games would be
              deleted at midnight. It was for GDC and it was fun to be
              comissioned to a game for!
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 16px" class="has-text-align-left">
              This means that delEAT no longer exists. It was a game about
              making cakes, based off the Cooking Mama and Tamagotchi games
              (Nintendo DS). Players made cakes and put them in the oven to
              cook. At midnight, all the cakes finished cooking, and exploded
              out of the oven and onto the screen.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 16px" class="has-text-align-left">
              It was great seeing everyone cheer and get excited about making
              cakes, and weirdly therapeutic deleting the game in the middle of
              the party. We gave everyone sweets when the game got deleted, so
              it was like their cakes came out of the game, and into the real
              life party!

            <p style="font-size: 16px" class="has-text-align-left">
              Find The Plot was one of the first games I ever made and was
              really happy with! It's a game about being a teenage girl, and
              being surrounded by boyband fan culture.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 16px">
              I made Find The Plot in a week, as part of a 'Game a Week'
              exercise. <br /><br />Find the Plot was my first game to be part
              of an exhibition, which is really exciting:<br />- Bar SK 2017
              'Game a Week' exhibition
