              Fitzroy House is a proposal for a new building system, to address
              the housing crisis and genrefication in Fitzroy. It proposes a kit
              of parts (kind of like lego blocks) that low income earners can
              use to create livable spaces in the back alleys of Fitzroy
              streets.

              I design Fitzroy Street as my final project for my Masters of
              Architecture. It sits somewhere in between architecture and games,
              and I encouraged the reviewers to imagine how they might use the
              building blocks to design housing solutions.

            <p style="font-size: 16px" class="has-text-align-left">
              During the design for this scheme, I visited Seoul, and was really
              taken by how the city shows it age and history - the underside of
              a industrial bridge marked with the changing tides of a river,
              grass popping through concrete paths, graffiti on structural
              columns. I found it all pretty beautiful, and thought it would be
              nice to design a 'school' that showcases the different ways humans
              and non humans alike, leave their mark on the city.

              In this project, I designed a park enclosed with a circular
              pavillion, where visitors could sit and watch people playing in
              the park. It was about creating times to stop, and watch.

              This scheme looked at ways to rennovate an existing 1940's house
              in Melbourne, and make it not only energy effecient, but
              regenerative in energy, resource, and for the larger community.
